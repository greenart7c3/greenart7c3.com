# Amber Privacy Policy and Terms of Use

## Privacy Policy

Effective as of May 6, 2024

The Amber app for Android does not collect or process any personal information from its users. The app is used to connect to third-party Nostr servers (also called Relays) that may or may not collect personal information and are not covered by this privacy policy. Each third-party relay server comes equipped with its own privacy policy and terms of use that can be viewed through the app or through that server's website. The developers of this open-source project or maintainers of the distribution channels (app stores) do not have access to the data located in the user's phone. Accounts are fully maintained by the user. We do not have control over them. 

The app may collect a per-device token, your public key, and a preferred Relay to connect to and provide push notification services through Google's Firebase Cloud Messaging. Other than that, the data from connected accounts are only stored locally on the device when it's required for the functionality and performance of Amber. This data is strictly confidential and cannot be accessed by other apps (on non-rooted devices). Phone data can be deleted by clearing Amber's local storage or uninstalling the app.

### Privacy with Relays services

Your internet protocol (IP) address is exposed to the relays you connect to. If you want to improve your privacy, consider utilizing a service that masks your IP address (e.g. a VPN) from trackers online.

The relay can also see which public keys you are using and what information you are requesting from the network. Your public key is tied to your IP address and your relay filters.

Relays have all your data in raw text. They know your IP, your name, your location (guessed from IP), your pub key, all your contacts, and other relays, and can read every action you do (post, like, boost, quote, report, etc) with the exception of the content inside Private Zaps and Private DMs.

While the content of direct messages (DMs) is only visible to you, and your DM Nostr counterparty, everyone can see when you and your counterparty are DM-ing each other. Image uploads in the DM screen use one of the chosen image servers and simply paste the image link on the DM text. Your uploaded pictures are available to anyone with that direct link. 

### Visibility & Permanence of Your Content on Nostr Relays

#### Information Visibility

Content that you share can be shared with other relays by any user of the network. 
Information that you share is publicly visible to anyone reading from relays that have your information. Your information may also be visible to Nostr users who do not share relays with you.

#### Information Permanence

Information shared on Nostr should be assumed permanent for privacy purposes. There is no way to guarantee deleting or editing any content once posted.

## Terms of Use

### For versions downloaded from Google's Play Store

You cannot use the Amber app for Android to submit Objectionable Content to relays. Objectionable Content includes but is not limited to: (i) sexually explicit materials; (ii) obscene, defamatory, libelous, slanderous, violent and/or unlawful content or profanity; (iii) content that infringes upon the rights of any third party, including copyright, trademark, privacy, publicity or other personal or proprietary rights, or that is deceptive or fraudulent; (iv) content that promotes the use or sale of illegal or regulated substances, tobacco products, ammunition and/or firearms; and (v) illegal content related to gambling.

### For versions downloaded from F-Droid

We do not control the distribution of the application in F-Droid. Legal matters should be resolved between the user and F-Droid. 

## Other Notes

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy and Terms of Use at any time. Any modifications to this document will be effective upon our posting of the new terms and/or upon implementation of the new changes on the Service (or as otherwise indicated at the time of posting). In all cases, your continued use of the app after the posting of any modified Privacy Policy and Terms of Use indicates your acceptance of the terms of the modified Privacy Policy and/or Terms of Use.
